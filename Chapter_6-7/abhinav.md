## A `File` Type
Create a type `File` that contains a string and supports following operations:
1. append : to append a String to the contents of the file
2. clear : to clear the contents 

In addition this type should also support, `==` and `/=` operations, where these operations returns result based on the comparison of underlying contents of file. Also, define `Show` interface for this type.
